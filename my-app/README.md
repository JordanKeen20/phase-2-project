# SpecialAide
This is the first page mock up to an Interactive Check List for special needs children that was created during my work in flatiron school. The point of this application is to encourage children to follow a schedule. This part of the application will give them a list of realistic expectations that the parent or gardian wants them to complete. 
The parent or gardian is able to make a schedule for the youth by entering the chores and/or event they are going to complete, for example:
    * go potty
    * take a bath
    * get dressed
    * eat breakfast
    * brush teeth
    * go to school (URL or picture to what school they go to)
    Ect.
If a child does not know how to complete the chore/expectation they may click on the picture and a video will pop up to show what needs to be done, for example:

If the child does not understand how to sweep they could click on the picture of a broom and dust pan. When they do a video of a person completeing the necessary steps will show them how.
